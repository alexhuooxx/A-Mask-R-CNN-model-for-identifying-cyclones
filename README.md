# A-Mask-R-CNN-model-for-identifying-cyclones
We first use a traditional automatic cyclone identification method to construct a trainable labeled dataset, then the Mask R-CNN was trained on this dataset. And finally trained network was again used on the same reanalysis data to identify additional cyclones.
